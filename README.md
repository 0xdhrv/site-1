## muan on jekyll

This is jekyll with coffescript and scss parsing on Github pages.
Completed with many many thanks to the resources on internet, especially [Litany against fear](http://quaran.to/blog/2013/01/09/use-jekyll-scss-coffeescript-without-plugins/) by Nick Quaranto.

## if you want to clone this

* This Jekyll is set up with coffeescript and scss compliers, run server by running `rake`.
* I have bourbon, it's a wonderful thing.
* Do scss and coffee in _assets/, they will be coverted and stored in javascripts/ and stylesheets/
* Put normal .js and .css files in javascripts/ and stylesheets/ and jekyll will deal with them
* There are some partials in _includes/, for Google Analytics, disqus, and stuff, to include, do  `{% include disqus.html %}`
* All the .md files are things I wrote, the only sensible decision would be to delete them.
* Feel free to use my layout and make changes to it I don't mind
* Your static site lives in _site/
* There are tracking stuff in the js file, you might want to remove them as well.
* I change things constantly, keep your own copy.

## that'll be all
