    So blessed to have [@notwaldorf](https://twitter.com/notwaldorf) as a friend. We chatted about cat persons/peppers in zelda/jean jackets/html spec last night and found this gem of [an old &lt;dialog&gt; html 5 draft spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/2008/WD-html5-20080122/#the-dialog) in HTML 5 Working Draft in 2008. 💡
