title: Revelation
---

I made it a routine to write down quotes from the lovely Bluefields people and share them with my close friends when I joined them months ago. Unfortunately, I somehow failed to keep this a secret and made a revelation last week.

**THIS IS NOT AT ALL AS CREEPY AS IT SOUNDS. **
Just thought I’d clarify that. 

I believe those, who have the privilege to experience the same amount of joy from me sharing the quotes, can all agree with this: all I did was handing down happiness.

The whole quoting exercise started by coincidences. At first there were just 2 or 3 jokes I found funny and wanted to tell my friends about. I did not at all expect this to become a thing; who'd have known, Bluefields people just keep on surprising me.

As the revelation went, Rob Heaton mentioned he would be curious to know what I found worth sharing to my friends. I reckon that is a reasonable idea, since these quotes are after all their intellectual properties(?). 

So as a first step, here's some of the quotes from this week:

---
 
 #1

> A: How can we have a project called bacon without eating any bacon?
(Hand out bagels with nothing but a slice of bacon inside.)
> 
> R: Then I guess we’ll be starting a project Ferrari tomorrow!

---

 #2

> (End of the day bug fixing)
> 
> Hungry P: My stomach starts eating itself.

---

 #3

> (Quote noted: “I’m not used to see Mu-An smile like that..”)
> 
> P: You’ll need to put that sentence in context…
> 
K: Or your friends will think you work with freaks, weirdos,.. (Interrupted)
> 
> R: And Rob.
