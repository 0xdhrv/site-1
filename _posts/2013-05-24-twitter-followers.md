I don't have many Twitter followers so it is an easy number to remember, I never intended to remember it, but it was just in my face so it is hard not to. 

I noticed how it drops sometimes. 

**WHY? GOD, WHY? **

When it happens one too many times, I hid it with CSS.

{% highlight css %}
[href='/followers'] { display: none; }
{% endhighlight %}

That'll be all. As you were.
