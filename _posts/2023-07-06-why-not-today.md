CONTENT WARNING: depression, suicide.

"Why not today?" I asked myself.

A year has passed by since I started to have strong suicidal thoughts daily. Ever since I started taking [SSRI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_serotonin_reuptake_inhibitor), things have gotten a lot better. 

"A lot," huh. 

Instead of thinking about death 100% of the days, I have perhaps 60% less of those days on average. And I have gotten more accustomed to these kinds of days and know how to deal with them to the best of my ability and available resources.

Whenever _the mood strikes_, I bake if I can. I take sleeping pills if it's time. I  try to not be alone as much as possible. Some days these aren't options, some days I am weaker and I just drink as much as I can (a new thing I started to do this year); on one particular day, I went out and bought charcoal, along with some barbecue ingredients.

"So are you just chugging along with life/work mostly normally but having thoughts about death increase?" a friend asked.

> I wouldn’t say normally. I have to try pretty hard to not think about how nice it’d be to die right this second. I think about it while in a meeting, while wiping down my countertop, while watering plants, while buying groceries, while hanging out with or talking to friends, while taking a bath, while having lunch with my coworkers, whenever I cross a street or walk past a bridge. And then I just would have to pull myself back and concentrate on the people or things in front of me. 

You would catch me saying, "sorry, would you say that again?" cause I wasn't there.

I have a bag of charcoal in my apartment. So now this question comes to mind on the bad days. "Why not today?"

As [previously discussed](/posts/depression), I don't physically want to kill myself; nevertheless, the bad days have been pushing me to take tiny steps, ones that are easy and far removed enough that don't trigger my survival instinct. Now that I have taken a step, a physical step, both my therapist and psychiatrist upped the frequency of our appointments and my dosage. 

So why not?

I think about how I don't have things in order yet. For example, no one has access to one of the accounts that is about to be merged with another company, and if I don't stay alive till then to deal with their merger (inconvenienced by Wall Street, lol), a lot of money goes to waste when it otherwise would have make some people I care about right now very happy. But does it matter if I was dead? Who is left to care? 

And another part of me think about if I could be like some of my other depressed friends, where [they don't have a problem with living, they suffer due to the status quo.](/notes/2023-05-21-oo) A lot of them have tried, really fucking hard, to make things better for themselves, but life continues to suck, and some of them get into the state of [learned helplessness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learned_helplessness). I don't think that applies to me, because I never really tried, by that I mean, I don't have a picture of what a life worth living looks like, so there's nothing to work towards.

So I don't know why today is not the day. Perhaps the step is still too big. I am going to keep thinking about it; meanwhile, I take tiny steps.

I smiled at you. I laughed with you. I baked you bread. I mailed you a postcard. I went out of my way to find gifts for you. I told you I had an amazing time. I thanked you for the company and/or the conversation. I embraced your children and made them like me. 

And I through the day.

One
single
day.
