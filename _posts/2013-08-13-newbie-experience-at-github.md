I decided to write a post about my first two weeks in GitHub. Here it is.

> Holy shit, I am a GitHubber!

The first week is the onboarding week at GitHub, the week of mind explosions and new friends. Same as before, there is an unlimited amount of flexibility, I could choose whenever I wanted to start, and GitHub will fly me over to San Francisco. 

After knowing about the Summit™ from our spiritual guide [@newmerator](https://twitter.com/newmerator), I didn't think it makes any sense to miss the Summit, so I decided to start a week before it.

I heard that Summit is when GitHub flies everyone and everyone's family(if they so choose to) to San Francisco from all over the world. They hang out, discuss a bit of serious businesses, and have fun. I've heard a lot of things, they all sounded nice.

I had no idea what I got myself into.

### First Week

I started the first week with 5 other people, they are [@connors](https://twitter.com/connors), [@rubiojr](https://twitter.com/rubiojr), [@jmickeyd](https://twitter.com/jmickeyd), [@bnferguson](https://twitter.com/bnferguson), and [@fabianperez](https://twitter.com/fabianperez). (plus [@raganwald](https://twitter.com/raganwald) but he was onboarded remotely.)

We were greeted by [@newmerator](https://twitter.com/newmerator) and our Buddies™. <br />
A buddy is someone who will hold your hand through the dark, who will be there to pick up your leftover brain pieces when it is blown, and who just fundamentally got your back.

I was oh-so-lucky to have 2 buddies, [@tclem](https://twitter.com/tclem) and [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo). To this day I still have no idea why that is, but I guess it's good.

So we opened our brand new Macs on the first day, and realised that there were a bajillion things to set up, a mountain pile of things to read, and a tonne of new toys to play with.

We joined GitHub and then, boom! everything is exposed to us, talk about transparency! There were so many things to read through, not just because we probably need to read them, but also they are all quite very interesting.

Imagine being someone who likes GitHub a lot, imagine the questions you thought about asking a GitHubber but was never sure if it would be appropriate.. now you have all the answers. It IS Christmas.

First week was chaotic, not in a bad way though. We learned the GitHub Setup™, met lots of local GitHubbers, and talked to people on our team. We tried to make some sense out of the chaos. There was an enormous amount of knowledge to take in, it was very overwhelming, but at the same time, everything was just so interesting that you would not want to miss any of it.

---

At some point of the first week, we the new hires of the week sat down with Tom Preston-Werner. In case if you don't know, Tom is the CEO of GitHub.

Tom talked to us about GitHub, about the culture, the way we do things, and the future of GitHub. He answered our concerns and doubts in an honest way. By that I mean, there are things that are uncertain, that are not definite, and he was clear about them.

He didn't act as if everything's all figured out, there is nothing to worry about, and welcome to the fricking GitHub empire where everything's carved in stones; because no, there are things to work out, there are ways we do things that might not scale, and we need to acknowledge and work on **making them better, together**. At that point I realised Matt Todd did an amazing job explaining GitHub to me after my interview day, because everything was spot on, exactly what got me crazy about GitHub after the interview, only presented as a much less structured conversation. :p

At the end of the first week, I started to worry about how am I ever going to be able to produce something meaningful quickly, because there are so much to familiarize myself with. So I asked, asked how is it possible, and every response I got was the same: **"don't worry about it."**

They are not saying I don't need to do work, but that I can quite comfortably pace myself, don't ever get stressed up about things, and don't be pressured into doing anything that I am not comfortable with. If I need time to read through stuff before jumping in, do that. If I want to dive right in, there will be no stopping me. It is normal to make mistakes, and people will be **happy** to help me, always.

> And don't worry about having to prove yourself. You proved yourself, that's why you're here.

The first week flew by in a blink.

No, I did not manage to read through even 10% of the things, and it's fiiiine.

### The Summit™

The Summit™ is a week-long thingy that happens twice a year, there will be events every day and night during the week and you are free to choose whatever you would and would not like to attend. As a newbie, I thought it'd make sense for me to try out everything, then perhaps take my pick the next time.

Starting on Sunday, summit began with a Giants game. There were a lot of people! At this point we were at 199 people. I thought I have already met with plenty of them during my first week, but no, I met about 70% of the local SF people, that is 70% of the 30% locals, then the remote 70% flew in. Watttttt? How do I even.

---

Here's roughly what we did:

Day 1: pre-game hangout - Giants game - more hanging out at a bar<br />
Day 2: (lightning) talks - BoFs - Small group dinner - Code Bass Live<br />
Day 3: (lightning) talks - more BoFs - Fancy dinner - Fancy dance(?)<br />
Day 4: Hack day - Code Bass 3<br />
Day 5: Do whatever you want with fellow GitHubbers - Party at Office 3.0

#### Talks

Just like kids at a carnival or toy factory, everything at GitHub is exactly what a designer/developer like me will find fascinating. The summit talks feel just like a tech conference. GitHubbers talk in conferences all over the globe throughout the year, now imagine all those awesome talks in one place and two days. What happened is -- you ran out of gifs for the mind-blowing expression.

Oh and did I mention we listen to talks sitting in couches?

#### BoFs

Birds of Feathers is when people gather in small groups and discuss different aspects of GitHub that you find interesting. You see.. I wanted to join at least 4 groups each time. If only I can cut myself in 4 pieces and still function.

#### Code Bass 3

[Code Bass 3](https://github.com/blog/1563-code-bass-3-july-31) was the only public event during summit. This time it was held in Public Works. In Code Bass 3 you can see GitHubbers DJing and dancing like crazy. It was the first time I saw @defunkt, and he was not coding, not doing founder-ish things, he was up that stage playing songs.

I was amazed at how good everyone is at DJing, I thought people just do it as a hobby, how good can it be? But I was wrong. I don't normally enjoy techno, but this time I did.

I highly recommend you coming the Code Bass 4 in six months. <3

There are a lot in Summit that I would love to get into details, but I would rather not blab it all out here. You get the idea, it's a carnival.

To be completely honest, it was a social overload. I am not an outgoing person, not an extrovert and extremely far from it. People who knew me before GitHub can all attest to this. Nevertheless, after the Summit, I was asked by a friend:

> Is it me or are you not as introverted as you used to be?

I wonder this myself before he asked.

During summit I had very little problem going up to people and introduce myself, and I sure did surprise myself.

Then I realised it all boils down to the environment and the people. I didn't feel the fear that I might not be interesting enough and will bore people, because GitHubbers do want to know me and talk to me. It might not be true in all cases, but it sure felt like it most of the time. :)

Still, I was exhausted and peopled up multiple times, but I wouldn't have it other ways. I wasn't able to meet everyone, but meeting everyone is more like a mission impossible. I wasn't feeling obligated to meet people, it was simply a shame to miss the chance of knowing any GitHubbers.

Everyone was super friendly and helpful. Again, one of the things I cannot stress enough about GitHub.

In my first week, I asked a question in our internal app about me worrying drive-by questions being rude in chatrooms, and I got 20 replies within hours, each telling me drive-bys are fine and there is never wrong in asking. Aside from the 20 replies, there were people who walked up to me and told me it was awesome that I asked because they had the same concern, and people who just come to assure me there was nothing to worry about. Seriously, GitHubbers are nice.

[The GitHub hiring story](/2013/07/24/github-hiring-story/) I wrote also received lots of love internally. In the two weeks, I cannot count how many times people came to me and told me they thought the post was awesome, how they wish they have written one, and that I should write more. I really wasn't expecting this.

So, these are my first two weeks, as [@haacked](https://twitter.com/haacked) told me: "The good times are just beginning!" I am sure there will be lots more to share down the road.

I tried and tried to avoid having things I wrote about GitHub sending a cult-y vibe, I don't know how well I did, but it is so exteremly hard. I am just honestly super happy that I am now a part of this group of amazing individuals, it is still unbelievable to me every morning when I wake up.

GitHub is a great place to be, but these posts are not here to glorify GitHub, but to share and spread the love. There should be more places like GitHub, places that optimise for happiness, our happiness; startups, especially. 

When it is your call, do things that are outrageous, do things that left people scratching their head wondering how is it ever possible. Zach's talk about how GitHub is [Keeping People](http://zachholman.com/talk/keeping-people/) is pretty awesome in this regard.
