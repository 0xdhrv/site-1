Here’s a little bit of keyboard shortcuts that I found useful to have for sublime text 2:

    javascript||
    // Put them in Preferences > Key Bindings - User

    [
      { “keys”: [“super+alt+down”], “command”: “duplicate_line” }, 
      { “keys”: [“alt+up”], “command”: “swap_line_up”},
      { “keys”: [“alt+down”], “command”: “swap_line_down”},
      { “keys”: [“super+d”], “command”: “run_macro_file”, “args”: {“file”: “Packages/Default/Delete Line.sublime-macro”} }
    ]
