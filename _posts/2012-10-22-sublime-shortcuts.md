title: Sublime Text 2 Mac Shortcuts
---

Here’s a little bit of keyboard shortcuts that I found useful to have for sublime text2:

    javascript||
    [
      { “keys”: [“super+alt+down”], “command”: “duplicate_line” }, 
      { “keys”: [“alt+up”], “command”: “swap_line_up”},
      { “keys”: [“alt+down”], “command”: “swap_line_down”},
      { “keys”: [“super+d”], “command”: “run_macro_file”, “args”: {“file”: “Packages/Default/Delete Line.sublime-macro”} }
    ]
