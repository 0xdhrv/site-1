So I went to Liverpool last weekend. Before I left on Saturday I kept thinking to myself: 

> Remind me why you're going again? doesn't make much sense..

Not just because going to Liverpool was perhaps an odd choice, but also because, why spending the weekend NOT writing code? AHHH. Exactly, why? Now I have more blank squares on Github. ARGH. Guess I'd just have to make a Chrome plugin to fill them all green.

Liverpool turned out to be not what I was expecting. I didn't come across any crazy football fans nor did I hear much of the distinct local accent. But nonetheless it was a good weekend, I was pleasantly surprised by what they have to offer.

I went to [The Egg Cafe](http://www.eggcafe.co.uk/), [Mello mello](http://mellomello.co.uk/), [The Quarter](http://www.thequarteruk.com/) and [Cuthbert's bakehouse](http://www.cuthbertsbakehouse.co.uk/). If you're ever going, I recommend checking them out. The Egg Cafe and Mello mello both serve vegetarian/vegan food, they are delicious not just by a vegetarian standard! Also, there are live performances in Mello mello.
