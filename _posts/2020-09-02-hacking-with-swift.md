title: Notes for Hacking with Swift
---

Trying out [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui). This would probably be my 5th attempt learning iOS/macOS development.

## Day 4
2020/09/06

```
Day 5 – functions, parameters, and errors
Day 8 – structs, properties, and methods
Day 9 – access control, static properties, and laziness
```

Tests for property observers seem wrong. [The valid code samples](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/review/property-observers) have closures that don't return anything.

Now googling for Swift REPL so I can write some stuff to remember them better ➡ [Introduction to the Swift REPL](https://developer.apple.com/swift/blog/?id=18).

Turns out I missed a few chapters for Day 5, specifically everything after **7. variadic functions** 🤦🏻‍♀️ because variadic parameters were in the **access control** tests. I went back to read them today as well.

## Day 3
2020/09/05

```
Day 5 – functions, parameters, and errors
Day 6 – closures part one
Day 7 – closures part two
```

Trailing closure syntax isn't confusing at all! Shorthand closure syntax isn't confusing at all!!

## Day 2
2020/09/04

```
Day 3 – operators and conditions
Day 4 – loops, loops, and more loops
```

`repeat { ... } while ...` is new to me.

## Day 1
2020/09/03

```
Day 1 – variables, simple data types, and string interpolation
Day 2 – arrays, dictionaries, sets, and enums
```

Sure `tuple` can exist.

<style>
  h2 + p { margin-top: -1.2em; font-size: .8em; }
</style>
