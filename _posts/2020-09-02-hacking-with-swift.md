title: Notes for Hacking with Swift
---

Trying out [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui). This would probably be my 5th attempt.

## Day 4
2020/09/06

Day 8 – structs, properties, and methods

- Tests for property observers seem wrong. The valid code samples have closures that don't return any computed values.

## Day 3
2020/09/05

Day 5 – functions, parameters, and errors
Day 6 – closures part one
Day 7 – closures part two

- Trailing closure syntax isn't confusing at all!
- Shorthand closure syntax isn't confusing at all!!

## Day 2
2020/09/04

Day 3 – operators and conditions
Day 4 – loops, loops, and more loops

- `repeat {} while ...` is new.

## Day 1
2020/09/03

Day 1 – variables, simple data types, and string interpolation
Day 2 – arrays, dictionaries, sets, and enums

- Sure `tuple` exists.

<style>
  h2 + p { margin-top: -1.2em; font-size: .8em; }
</style>
