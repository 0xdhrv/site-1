title: Design 設計 ?

My housemate is learning Chinese, and she asked me why 設計 means design. As a designer and a native Chinese speaker, I feel obliged to solve this mystery and share it. So here is goes:

設 = 言 + 殳<br />
言 means words, means talking.<br />
殳 as in hand holding tools or weapons, later extended to mean activity.<br />
so 設 means to build, set or make.

計 = 言 + 十<br />
言 is the same, meaning words/talking.<br />
十 is the number, 10.<br />
so 計 is to calculate.

Build/set/make + Calculate = _Design_

There it is, your Saturday Chinese lesson. For more, feel free to read the [Chinese character classfication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_character_classification). I was surprised initially finding out both 設 and 計 are ideogrammatic words, but no, it does make sense after thinking about it.

Yap, I forgot how difficult Chinese was.

Fun fact: most people learn and type Chinese by [pinyin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin) now, including my housemate, but we Taiwanese learn and type Chinese using [zhuyin, i.e. bopomofo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bopomofo) instead, that's why we can type almost non-translatable words like these: ㄔㄥˊㄇㄣˊㄐㄧㄉㄢˋㄍㄠ, and everyone from Taiwan would still understand.

Happy Easter.
