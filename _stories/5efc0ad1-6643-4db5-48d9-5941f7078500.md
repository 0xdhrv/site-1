  My hairstylist is so good. Here’s a still from a selfie video of me admiring my own simple blowout ☺️. I always feel like a fraud posting way too flattering photos of myself and Risa said to me, “we can appreciate we are able to at least *sometimes* be content with our appearances.” That eased my mind. “THIS PHOTO IS PROVIDED AS IS.”
