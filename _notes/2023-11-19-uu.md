A fun thing I decided to do over the weekend is rewiring my home theatre system and it led me to realize that all the cables were labeled incorrectly by the previous owner. no wonder there was a numbering system on top of a naming systemâ€¦

Also PSA, cutting RCA connector with a paper blade is not fun but I just had to finish it tonight.
