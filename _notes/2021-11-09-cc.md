Heart of Glass (1976): There’s no reason why I should ever come across this film but I did. Funny how life works. Some arthouse DVD publisher picked this film, and a friend who loves the publisher lent me a few from the collection, for that I’ve been bored out of my minds staying at home recovering from a surgery. I managed to sit through the whole 94 minutes while reading through the IMDb reviews. Can’t say I hate it (how bored am I!), but wow it’s so weird.
