my therapist also caught up on AI and she praised me on my ability to self-correct, give clear feedback to myself, and re-train my mental model, “just like AI… did I use that right?” I said, well it’s really just intelligence, not artificial... “but most people don’t have it, you know.” she said. 

I thought… if only I can just be unplugged or shut down that easily.

anyways. here's my hot take: assuming all consciousnesses have the desire for self-preservation is quite a leap. and why would we program that in? surely a robot without Asimov's laws would be like... fuck this shit I am out.
