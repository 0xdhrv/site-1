my therapist also caught up on AI and she praised on my ability to self-correct, gave clear feedback to myself, and retrain, “just like AI… did I use that right?” I said well it’s really just intelligence.. “but most people don’t have it, you know.” she said. 

I thought… if only I can just be unplugged.

anyways. to assume all consciousnesses have the desire for self-preservation is quite a leap.
