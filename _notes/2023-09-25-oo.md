Captain Phillips (2013): By now you might have gathered that I am drawn to only 4 genres of films: wars, America!!! (in a “they really do be thinking about themselves that way” way), racial topics, and cults.

But anyways, my indifference to Tom Hanks aside, this was a great film. And Barkhad Abdi’s debut?! wtf. I wish there was more backstory about the Somalians in place of the crew members’ fear of pirates.
