A introduced me to B when she was briefly back to Taiwan. I didn’t talk much at the party because I don’t enjoy crowds nor alcohol. I made an excuse to leave and met B by the restrooms, we talked for a long time, and really vibed. B confessed later, “My girlfriend (C) taught me all that. I am just reciting words. You two would really get along.”

I met C and we are definitely on the same wavelength. I ended up hanging with B & C a bunch.

A finally met C the other day, and told me C couldn’t stop talking about how great I am. I said “wow I really thought they were only hanging by because I am the depressed friend you assigned to them. They really don’t need to include me in their couple outings.”

Anyways. Remember my review on Baby Reindeer? I empathize with Martha so much.
