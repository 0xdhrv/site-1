Escapism.

I'd like to be able to write these notes like other people; people who write week notes with such openness and matter of fact-ness. I think emotions have been the main driving force for my life for a bit, but I try my best to push it to the background so things like work, hobbies, and socialization can keep happening in the foreground. When I look back on a week though, the foreground dissipates.

These crumbs that she thinks I shouldn't keep picking up are the only fuel source left.
