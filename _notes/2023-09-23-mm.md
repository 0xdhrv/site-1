I keep trying to place the tone of these sentences and failing.

“are you being sincere or sarcastic?” a recurring message I send to my correspondents.

even f2f, “you’re smiling too much and it’s suspicious. no one (me) is that happy.”

insecurity at a all time high now. 
you know what? I will act like I don’t care instead.
