you gotta understand, the idea of being taken care of is just such a foreign concept and experience to me. I asked my dad last night “when have you and mom taken care of each other? I thought that was the whole point of having someone is for.” and he barely came up with some examples. I am not saying there’s a “need” to be taken care of, but if you have grown up and was forced to be an adult early, it is exhausting. Especially so when life punches you in the face with say, the pandemic, depression, or any sorts of serious illness. Knowing that you have no one no community to fall back on other than yourself when your self is crumbling… that shit is scary and it spirals.
