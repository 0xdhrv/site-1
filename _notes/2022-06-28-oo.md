In the past year or so I have received a couple of unprompted kind messages from strangers and mutuals, like... "I've been a big fan of your work since a long time ago." Obviously these messages make me happy, but I am at the same time so, so, so confused. What have I done? I am drawing a blank. I wish I remember them and can appreciate them from the eyes of these strangers so I don't feel so insecure and socially anxious all the freaking time.
