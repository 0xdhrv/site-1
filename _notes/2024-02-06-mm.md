[RSS readers make me want to jump into a vat of acid!](https://gkeenan.co/avgb/rss-readers-make-me-want-to-jump-into-a-vat-of-acid) by Keenan

I never really read all the feeds I subscribe to. What I do read though is personal newsletters. Perhaps I should start doing newsletters.

At the end of the day to all of you, I want you to enjoy my website because I love websites and I enjoy making it and continue to improve it. It’s a shame that RSS readers take away my personality.

Newsletter on the other hand would really just serve as a reminder to be like time to heyyyyyy check out my site?

Like this note if you’d subscribe, thanks. :))))
