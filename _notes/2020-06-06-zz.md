This is and has always been the oppressed’s normal. Everything is political. This manifest for me through the never-ending campaign against CPC’s invasion threats, propaganda, and election interferences, and for Taiwan independence plus decolonization. Perhaps you do need a new normal if it doesn’t already contain activism, because many don’t have a choice.
