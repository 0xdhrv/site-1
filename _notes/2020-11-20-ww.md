Life update: I moved back to Taiwan, finished the 2-week quarantine, mastered the spelling of Q-U-A-R-A-N-T-I-N-E, found an apartment, bought a sofa and 2 plants, took a day trip to Kaohsiung, got back to Taipei, and am currently waiting for the internet company person to come give me life so I can play video games again.
