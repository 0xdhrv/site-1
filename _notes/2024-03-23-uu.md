My insomnia has leveled up and now I wake up perhaps 3-8 times a night. This morning I stopped sleeping and fell face forward onto the corner of a wall and now rocking a big cheekbone bruise.

Donâ€™t worry. I am making an appointment to get a monitored sleep session at the hospital to see wtf is wrong with me.
