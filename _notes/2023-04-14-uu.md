in response to a friend’s question about politics I wrote a freaking essay in messages, didn’t get a response (we proceed to talk about other things). that was months ago. it’s just sitting in messages collecting dusts. what a waste. it was how I found out if you wrote too long a message there would a navigation view change in the messages app.
