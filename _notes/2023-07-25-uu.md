there are these concentric circles, and within each there is a finite number of dots of varying colors. the dots can be moved inwards or outwards. the most inner 2 circles have no dots. the outer circles have dots. the number of dots peaks in the 4th circle. in the 3rd circle there are mostly purple dots. in the 5th circle there are mostly orange dots. act accordingly.
