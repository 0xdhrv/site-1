<details><summary>depression (therapy notes)</summary>my therapist told me it was very worrying for her that after the last session where I told her I had the worst day to date and was suggested to consider a psychiatry facility (which she supported), and then not hearing from me for months. but, she also trusts that I would make the right decision for myself. I mean. I hope so. I also wish I know where this trust comes from. From my perspective, I am mostly impulsive, stubborn, andâ€¦ incompetent.</details>
