got to meet a lot of cool people lately and you know what’s awesome? they come to my website be immediately read how depressed I am. we are either friends for life now or will never speak again. quick elimination here.

the other day my physical therapist casually mentioned “primary family” and I basically said hi please tell me more about how you know this term plus I think we are bestie now.
