got to meet a lot of cool people lately and you know what’s awesome? they come to my website and immediately see how depressed I am through the posts. and now we are either friends for life now or will never speak again. quick elimination process at work here.

the other day my physical therapist casually mentioned “inherited family trauma” as he was fixing my shoulders and I basically said yes please tell me more about how and why you know this term plus I think we are best friends now. to meet a born and raised taiwanese person who know a thing or two about this?! needles in a haystack!
