[Wave Makers](https://www.netflix.com/us/title/81655481), a Taiwanese drama endorsed by our current president… is honestly too real that it made me feel like I was at work, during an election, anxious, and even a bit triggered. I guess if you want to see how life is in Taiwan, it’s a very realistic depiction. But honestly I can’t bring myself to play the second episode.
