It’s funny how DTR works differently to different people, like promotions! It seems logical to only do couple things as a couple, just like how managing people should be the job of a manager. But I guess no? IRL you gotta perform at a higher level for years before you could be promoted, and similarly people can date for a year as friends and decide to not be a couple. Isn’t life fun?
