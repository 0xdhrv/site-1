things continue to suck. blessed to have received some thoughtful texts from like 4 friends amongst an ocean of truly awful takes literally around every corner of the internet. y'all are my number ones.

my one objective in life right now is to distract myself as much as possible for as long as possible because ✨ reality is overrated ✨.
