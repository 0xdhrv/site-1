Re: "an environment that allows you to do the best work of your life"â€“ I really  like my early days at GitHub because there were so many people with different expertises to learn from, and they are available and happy to share their knowledge. I was just looking up posts about partial index strategies w/ postgresql and jnunemaker's post was the first result. Instant nostalgia.
