Excuse me. My whole life I watch people who have nothing at stake argue how much freedom Taiwanese people should have and what government we deserve. Just no. You don't get to decide what's *not that bad* (aka you could suffer more) and what's *bearable* (aka you could power through) when the things did not happen and are not happening to *you*. Believe the people **with the experience** when they say "THINGS ARE FUCKED. IT IS THAT BAD."
