I like it when I talk to friends about personal feelings and they feel comfortable suggesting that I book an appointment with my therapist to talk about specific things. They want to help but know they can’t do as good a job as my therapist; what they can do instead was something I can’t do myself, telling me the things I regard as trivial and unworthy of a therapy session, are in fact affecting me in ways I hadn’t noticed before.
