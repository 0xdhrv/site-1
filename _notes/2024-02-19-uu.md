Slow Horses (TV Series 2022‑ ): took me forever to get into this and I finished it so quickly :(

me: Sophie Okonedo looks much older in the show.
friend: Bad styling/role?
me: I don’t mean old as a bad thing. She looks cool af. I aspire.
friend: Ah. She played a lot of bad bitch roles. Kristin Scott Thomas is great too. I saw her in theater once actually playing a crazy lady. (also a compliment)
