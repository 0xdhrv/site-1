friends suggested that I start a gratitude journal to make life more bearable because it lower the threshold of what is considered something to be thankful and happy for.

and once again I got stuck in the loop of “if this is what it takes I really would rather X” despite I am not capable to X. so I guess I need into get into gratitude journaling?

the world is freaking crumbling though. to be grateful for the smallest things seem futile in the face of overwhelming grieve and suffering.
