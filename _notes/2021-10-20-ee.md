Dunkirk (2017): I enjoyed a lot more than I thought I would. I mostly picked it up because of Cillian Murphy, who is my all time favorite, even though his part wasn't even named. I actually cared that they make it home.

I've always wanted to write notes after seeing a film; just to capture how I felt about it so I'd remember, not to critic. So the notes are unhelpful and unworthy of imdb, where I log all the films. Maybe I'll start putting them here.
