Don't Look Up (2021): so realistically depressing that i donâ€™t know why a film has to be made. pretty much a documentary. only two unrealistic things stood out:
1 the us is not the only country with scientists.
2 boys like yule who can communicate openly, honestly, and effectively do not exist. ðŸ™ƒ
