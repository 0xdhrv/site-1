I see a number of you supported that I just stay in Taiwan and get cat or two; this is instead of traveling around (not possible with cats) and find out what’s possible out there.

Completely unscientifically, like this note if you support I continue to not get cats and go fuck around and find out what’s out there. Because apparently 10 years away from Taiwan wasn’t enough.
