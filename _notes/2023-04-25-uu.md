For those of you who are curious how I write these notes, [I just wrote it down in an issue](https://github.com/muan/site/issues/45). If anyone good at shell scripts wanna rewrite my scripts so I don’t need to install please send me a PR. I mean, that is only if the shell script end up being very easily understandable. Also for all your information, scrolling is really broken in Apple Shoutcuts’ text prompts.
