I really wish internationalization settings are more flexible. On PlayStation if I want Traditional Chinese subtitles I often need to change my system UI to from English to TC, which means voice prompts won't work, and then the game UI also can't be set to English because games usually only have one or two language settings– subtitles and audio, and not UI. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Game content internationalization should prioritize authenticity around the story, while user interface internationalization should prioritize accessibility for the user and social interactions. The data is all there!
