My friend is going to go on a weeklong hike so he’s bringing his cat to mine for me to take care of. This will be the third time I think I’m ready to talk about sharing custody of the cat. Like this note if you think I should do it. And this is already the biggest commitment I can make. A full-time cat, forever? no~~~
