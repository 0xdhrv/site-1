ka: "muan you look so good today?? your skin looks dewy!"

me: "oh gosh! Thank you! I thought so too! I woke up this morning, looked at the mirror, and was so confused as to why I looked this way today."

I did use a facial mask Risa gave me the night before but I have never been a believer of facial mask. I have been converted???
