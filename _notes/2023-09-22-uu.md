thinking about hiding all the depression posts so I can pretend to be normal and not scare people off

in therapy today we talked about being in and out of control
 
a depressed friend said she felt less desperate after talking to me but all I did was saying that yes your feelings are all valid and itâ€™s reasonable to feel shit. why did she become unreasonable afterwards???
