Switched to Firefox, already had to modify a bunch of things in `about:config` that ~ might void my warranty ~. `apz.allow_zooming`â€“ enable pinch to zoom, `accessibility.tabFocus`- enable tab focus on links (system setting is overriden by Firefox :(), and `mousewheel.with_meta.action`- disable meta + scroll zoom.
