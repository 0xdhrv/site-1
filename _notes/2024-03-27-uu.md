A total shot in the dark I booked an appointment with different psychiatrist in order to get the sleep analysis in a different hospital. As I recited my history of insomnia, depression, and the list of meds I’ve been on, his reaction was a pure “fuck, that must have been tough af” and that alone is really all I need. Not “have you tried X/Y” “how about you do more of Z,” but an assumption that I must have done all I could because of the severity of the conditions.

If life was D&D I have a lucky trait that’s for sure.
