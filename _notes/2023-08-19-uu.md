someone said to me this song [you gotta be](https://open.spotify.com/track/6CU0zWIWVTEnmWpSjVHM93?si=k2SB310MR-2SVV5Hzp2fuA&context=spotify%3Asearch%3Ayou%2Bgott) is like a pep talk and excuse me I donâ€™t know what world you came from. It stresses me out so much. I gotta be none of that and it should be OK!!!
