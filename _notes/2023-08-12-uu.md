so hereâ€™s me thinking, I gotta replace depression pretzel with something more basic, you know, more commonly seen. so I asked my baker friend for just a plain old sponge cake recipe (which I had failed at two times 4 years ago or so), and guess what, I failed at depression sponge cake. now feeling even worse. excellent.
