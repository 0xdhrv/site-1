Top Gun: Maverick (2022): I really can’t care less about the first one but this one is not bad. Rolled my eyes so far back on many of the clichés and the romantic interest who has absolutely no background nor personality other than the vocation to wait for and support the making of very important career decisions of an emotionally unavailable man :) Fighting is cool. I’d take a film with just fighting over this blend. Lastly, too many filler scenes featuring the subjective attractiveness of Tom Cruise.
