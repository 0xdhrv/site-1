Last Night in Soho (2021): I am simple I see Edgar Wright I buy tickets. I didnâ€™t even watch the trailer so it was totally my own fault. I had no idea it was a thriller and I hate thrillers. Nevertheless it has all the Edgar Wright signatures and I enjoyed it as much as I can possibly enjoy a thriller.
