peaky blinders got me missing birmingham uk which I thought was impossible. all those mentions of the snowhill station which I walked pass everyday for 3 years. cillian murphy still number one my fav actor of all time. also, lol, it was the first time I noticed tom hardy; had to google who this v good actor playing alfie was. who knew!
