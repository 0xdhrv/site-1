the audacity of some men to just come out and say “let’s discuss these very serious issues wrt to gender equality and politics. I am reasonable and logical and really open-minded.” and then leave with “well I can’t be convinced because I never studied the history of X, but if you were reasonable you would see my point” your point? your uneducated point?

oh get me away from here I am dying.
