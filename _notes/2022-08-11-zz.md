[Hidde](https://twitter.com/hdv) told me I got a mention at [Saying Thank You](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2022/saying-thank-you/) â™¥ï¸Ž. While I would love to receive nice messages, I still think including a reply mechanism by default is risky, given the number of unpleasant emails I receive every so often. ðŸ« 

Been exploring alternatives though; with something like [`<open-heart>`](https://github.com/muan/open-heart-element), which Iâ€™ve implemented on notes and posts on my site, I can now receive anonymous â™¥ï¸Ž emoji. ðŸ˜¬
