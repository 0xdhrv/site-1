I saw people get mad at others calling out that web browsers are meant for document viewing and not applications and want to debate it... The thing is, this really isn’t an opinion though. @kocienda was stating a fact. Document viewing was what the web was designed for. Pulling up examples of what people has used the web for isn’t going to change how the web was designed  and why manipulating it into something it’s not is extremely messy and awkward. I can only assume those who think it’s not messy and awkward haven’t done much accessibility work. a11ysupport.io alone is proof enough. Just write native code if you want to make apps, people (reason why I tried to learn Swift). How about discussing how to lower the much higher barrier of entry for native app development instead of forcing the web to become an app platform?
