With all these talks about “Ukraine now Taiwan next”… regardless of whether that’s a valid comparison, I just want to say that if we find Taiwan in the same situation, I sure hope more of my friends would be voicing their support for us on social media. No, tweeting can’t end a war, but I think it’d definitely give me more hope and strength to go on.
