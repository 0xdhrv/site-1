[https://muan.co/photos](https://muan.co/photos) is a new thing! I will definitely forget how this work so here it is:

- I add a photo to an iCloud Shared Album from my phone
- A GitHub Action running on a schedule (tbd) fetches from the Shared Album data
- Downloads all the images and converts them to an ideal format
- Puts all the data into a JSON file
- Triggers a `workflow_dispatch` event on `muan/site`
- Another GitHub Action pulls down the JSON and commits it into `muan/site/_data`
- GitHub Pages automatically rebuilds from the data file changes
- Profit!
