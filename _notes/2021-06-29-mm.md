I wish I knew how to step in/out of "the zone". When I get into a programming problem I find it so hard to just switch off. I ended up not sleeping and not eating, and even when I managed to just microwave something I feel like I have to eat in front of the computer so I can keep thinking about the problem. While I enjoy "being in the zone" I can't help but feel like it's just terrible for my well-being. I believe this is partly why I have been trying to stay away from coding as much as possible ever since quitting last year. :(
