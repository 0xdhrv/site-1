So in Taiwan the hottest topic this weekend were the referendum and WLHâ€™s divorce.  Everyone I met yesterday wanted to discuss WLH and I justâ€¦ canâ€™tâ€¦ careâ€¦ less. I really donâ€™t want to be seen as if I feel so above it, but I am at a point that I feel like I had to read it up to not be such an outlier. I guess what Iâ€™m trying to get at isâ€¦ how can not caring about celebrity gossip be such a special stance? Iâ€™m not trying to be different. ðŸ˜•
