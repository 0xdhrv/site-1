After I made my mind up to quit GitHub, I got a new manager, and I gave my notice in our first 1:1. His previous reports all loved him and he tried to retain me to the best of his ability. I didn't change my mind because I received no support for a solid 6 months from any one up the chain before he took over. A company created that toxic environment, and a single person won't be able to turn it around. My new manager left a month later as well. ðŸ™ƒ
