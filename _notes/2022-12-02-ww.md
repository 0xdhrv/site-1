- Yes I went on parental leave. I gave birth to a healthy depression baby.

- A structured diary much like the one I kept for sleep CBT. "what time did I take the pills", "any tirggers today", "do I feel like socializing today", "did I socialize today", "if/when did I think about dying today, and how many times", etc.

- Spending half of the day putting myself together after waking up, and the other half working.
