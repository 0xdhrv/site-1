friend: you home? can I come pick up my throw and hang?
me: can’t hang. my apartment is a mess now, but would you drive me to pharmacies? I need refills like yesterday.
friend: sure.
(after 7 pharmacies I got my refill)
me: wanna come hang, help me tidy up my apartment so there is surface to walk on while I make us dinner so I can finally deal with my costco haul?
friend: sure.

friend cut down 30 boxes, reinstalled my curtains, reshelfed my shelves, mopped up my kitchen floor.
