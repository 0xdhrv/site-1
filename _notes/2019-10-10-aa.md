Today is the [National Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Day_of_the_Republic_of_China) of the Republic of China (aka Taiwan?????). On 10 October 1911, the ROC was established, in **China**, when no one on the island of Taiwan spoke Mandarin. The ROC lost to the CCP(PRC) and fled to Taiwan in 1949, declared martial law, banned Taiwanese, and killed people by tens of thousands. I am Taiwanese. Today is not my national day.
