Iâ€™ve muted so many people on Facebook that whenever I add a new friend, Facebook will show every single one of their post to me because there's often nothing else new. And I then have to mute the new friend because wow friend how did you get the time to post stuff daily?

Perhaps I just need a weekly digest of how my friends are doing.
