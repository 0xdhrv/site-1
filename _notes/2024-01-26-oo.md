some positives :3

- I have some really nice friends who care deeply about me and I do them too.
- I still play squash weekly wherever possible.
- I have taken up knitting since around the holiday (again) and found it to be a good commute activity. don’t ask me what I am knitting because it’s the act not the outcome that matters.
- regularly taking my meds and have a healthy relationship with my therapist (aka whenever I am troubled I do reach out to them and other times I process and take notes in preparation for the next session).
- I’m trying to make plans for the future because I think having things to look forward would help.
- I am hanging on.
