the other night I went to a restaurant with a web dev friend and we started discussing their COVID QR code ordering website because he wanted to know if I would have used the figure element and I went off- "but you could have built this without modals, without tabs, without JavaScript, in a completely accessible manner. not this slow janky inaccessible abomination." and I walked through how I would have markup the site. it was so great.
