friend: you home? I want to drop off a box of wedding cookies aka 喜餅 (implying she’s getting married)
me: oh wow congrats! but no thanks

you’d find zero ounce of traditional value in me. this I guess also potentially means I won’t go to her wedding since the invite usually comes with the save-the-date I think? she gets me tho 🫶🏼
