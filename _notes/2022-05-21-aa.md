here’s a lesson I learned: never ever invest your time and energy in accessibility when your organization doesn’t care about it. people hold organizations to a high standard and by extension anything you attempt, so nothing you alone can do will ever be good enough to people externally, and thus internally it would not appear that your efforts were worthwhile and you would never succeed nor be recognized for your efforts. you would be thankless, you would get crumbs for rewards if any, and you would be burnout for years to come. don’t be so cruel to yourself. just don’t do it.
