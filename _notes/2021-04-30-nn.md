I had wanted to join Basecamp not because the books they’ve put out but because the people I’ve met who had worked there and were working there until the recent announcement. Their leaving only confirms that feeling. I would love to have worked with empathetic people with integrity. Though at the same time I would also hate to have to leave with the environment because of shitty rich men who can’t be arsed to care about other people while sitting in their mountain piles of cash.
