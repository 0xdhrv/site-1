Thanks to my therapist Iâ€™ve been feeling so good in the last 6 months and was even able to make some traditionally nerve-wreaking decisions in life without even flinching. I love that I simply present her with a messy bag of ideas, and worries and she just untangles the wires and sorts them out. Being able to see problems and trade-offs clearly made decisions so much easier.
