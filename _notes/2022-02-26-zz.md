appreciate the friends who have reached out to recognize what I’ve always been talking about with regards to Taiwan’s political situation isn’t hypothetical… but I feel conflicted…

I guess it’s just disappointing. we learn to live with threats and risks because what else is there to do? and then we further learn to live with people around us who _like_ the aggressor and praise them when the regime does something “good” because they can afford to ignore the aggressions and threats that we and many experience.

i can’t in any circumstances ever see “good” in a regime that talks about invading my home for as long as i’ve lived. they desperately want to convince everyone that it’d not be an invasion, but a unification (via military forces). bullshit is what it is.

we seek support in times of relative peace. if we don’t find them in times of peace, will we be able to get them when things get dire? that’s what’s disappointing. when it really does matter, support isn’t going magically appear just because the stakes are high.

no, i don’t think the situations are alike or comparable on many front, but concerns from friends put things in that frame, and when I think about it with that framing, what’s out there now inspires little confidence. it is just quite disheartening. 🤷🏻‍♀️

i hope these concerns will translate into motivation to support us on things that don’t seem immediately related to war in the traditional sense. even if small as the country `<select>` in your product.

being apolitical is a vote of support for the existing rich and powerful.
