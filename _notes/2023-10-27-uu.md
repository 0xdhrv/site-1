a friend said since I couldn’t sleep, I might as well go to the Fish market in the AM as it’s the Tsukiji of Taiwan. I woke up at 4 (without an alarm obviously) and went. It was not it.

I got a car to go see the sunrise and the taxi driver was worried about my safety and said he’d wait for me for 3 minutes. 

I went back to the car and told him the guard wouldn’t let me into the park because you need to pre-register for the right to see sunrise in the park, apparently. Then it started raining. 

How’s your morning?
