growing sucks in ways like I now have to read the fine prints and find out that cold meds canâ€™t be mixed with SSRIs?!

growing up is awesome in ways like I now know more about what I want. for example musky perfumes are my jam and occasional breaks from hyper independence is perhaps the best gift someone can give me.
