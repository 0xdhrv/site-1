Today I am thankful to the friends who support me but ALSO push me to be better all the time. Like my squash coach who’d always say “just one more! you can do it!” and I’d say “I really can’t. You mistook me for someone else.” and yet I did it. Thank you for seeing and believing in a better version of me when I can’t.
