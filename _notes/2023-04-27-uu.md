Today I am thankful to the fiends who support me but ALSO pushes me to be better all the time. Like my squash coach who’d always say “just one more! you can do it!” and I’d say “I really can’t. You mistook me for someone else.” and I yet did it. Thank you for seeing a better version of me when I can’t.
